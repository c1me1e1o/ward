A simple drawing app using HTML and Javascript.

Primary and secondary colors are provided below the drawing canvas that the user can select right away. I had originally planned to connect the colors to a JSON server and then render them on screen using the knowledge we have learned so far. The user would then be able to hover and pick the color to draw on the HTML canvas. But, implementing it this way using JSON as a color-picker is more complex than what my current skill level can provide. Nor, is it clear from my research, if it is even do-able. Even, so, the research that I found suggest that it is a clunky and inelegant approach. I don't even know why someone would approach it that way, unless, it was just a way to fulfill some check box.... 

So, the current version of my app simply uses HTML and Javascript for the color-picker. 

With that said, there are also "Undo" and "Clear" buttons to the left of the color squares and to the right is a color-picker and a bruch-size slider.

Simply use the provided primary or secondary color-squares or use the color-picker to choose your color to draw with. 

And, that's it. 

So, happy drawing and have a great day!
