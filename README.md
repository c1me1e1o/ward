A simple drawing app using HTML and Javascript.

Primary and secondary colors are provided below the drawing canvas for the user to select right away. There are also "undo" and "clear" buttons to the left of the color squares and to the right is a color-picker and a brush-size slider.

Simply click on the color-squares with your mouse or the color-picker to choose the color of your heart's desire and then, click and hold your mouse button on the white canvas to start drawing. If, you make a mistake, press "undo" or start over and press "clear." If, you would like to change the size of your brush, sliding the brush-slider to the right will increase it, and sliding it to the left, will decrease it. As a default, the brush size is set to "2."

And, that's it. 

Happy drawing and have a great day!
